            <p>
                <b>Arvala-7 was a remote desert planet with a barren, rocky surface and breathable atmosphere</b>. During the New Republic Era, it was home to the Ugnaught Kuiil, who lived on a moisture farm with his blurrg. Sometime after Kuiil moved to the world, a group of Nikto mercenaries built an encampment, inside which they kept captive a youngling of the same species as the late Jedi Master Yoda.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Having accepted a contract to retrieve Grogu for his client, the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin traveled to Arvala-7</b> in his gunship, the Razor Crest. He met Kuiil after the Ugnaught saved him from a blurrg attack, and the farmer offered to help Djarin locate his quarry. Kuiil led Djarin to the mercenary encampment on blurrg mounts and left the Mandalorian to capture the asset on his own. With the help of IG-11, an IG-series assassin droid also working for the Bounty Hunters' Guild, Djarin eliminated the Nikto and located Grogu. He then rescued the youngling from IG-11, who intended to kill him per the Client's request.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Upon returning to the Razor Crest, Djarin discovered his ship had been scrapped</b> by local Jawas for spare parts. With the help of Kuiil, the bounty hunter was able to negotiate a trade for the parts in exchange for a mudhorn egg. Djarin traveled into the cave where the mudhorn dwelt, and only managed to defeat the beast after Grogu used the Force to levitate it. With the egg handed over to the Jawas, Djarin was able to repair his ship and leave Arvala-7.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Djarin would later return to the planet with Carasynthia Dune</b> to recruit Kuiil's help in caring for Grogu while they went on a mission to the planet Nevarro. Kuiil agreed to come along only if IG-11, whom the Ugnaught had repaired and reprogrammed, and the blurrg were allowed to join. After Djarin reluctantly agreed, the newly-formed team departed for Nevarro.

Locations such as a bar and a port were found on the surface. Around 9 ABY, the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin arrived at Maldo Kreis aboard his personal starship and captured a Mythrol at the bar after defeating the trawlers there. He departed the planet after a brief struggle with a ravinak.

                <b>Nevarro was a volcanic planet located in a sector of the Outer Rim Territories</b>. A city on Nevarro was home to a number of various individuals, including the Bounty Hunters' Guild, who were based out of a cantina on the planet. During the Imperial Era, the Galactic Empire controlled Nevarro, though they lost control of the planet after the end of the Galactic Civil War.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>In the time of the New Republic, the planet and its city became a haven for bounty hunters working for Greef Karga</b>, an agent of the Guild. The planet saw brief conflict when the bounty hunter Din Djarin rescued Grogu, an infant that he had delivered to a member of an Imperial remnant in a previous job, betraying the Guild. After Djarin's escape from Nevarro, the planet was taken over by the forces of the Imperial remnant, who were led by the former Moff Gideon. Karga eventually tricked Djarin into returning to Nevarro with the Child, though later changed his mind about allowing the Child to be given to the Imperials, and worked alongside Djarin to defeat them. Despite the arrival of Moff Gideon, Djarin and his associates managed to defeat the Imperial remnant, giving Karga and soon-to-be Marshal Carasynthia Dune the chance to turn the planet into one of respectable business.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Djarin continued on his journey with his small companion before returning to Nevarro for repairs</b>. After reuniting with Karga and Dune, Karga set his mechanics on the repairs and the two showed him the city. Karga then requested that Djarin help them destroy an Imperial base on the planet. There, they discovered that Moff Gideon was alive and was trying to retrieve the Child to use his blood for experimental research.

            <p>
                <b>Trask was an estuary moon orbiting the gas giant Kol Iben</b>. Trask was a black market port, and its population consisted mostly of Mon Calamari and Quarren. It featured a series of landing platforms and an inn where chowder was served. There was a rule for departing ships against ascending into the upper atmosphere inside the harbor zone.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>The Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin took a job to transport a passenger</b> and her spawn to her husband, who had settled on Trask as it was the only world hospitable to their species. As they came into the atmosphere, Djarin had to manually land the Razor Crest with no guidance and crashed into the shallow sea. He paid a Mon Calamari a thousand credits to fix his ship as he entered the port town. Djarin reunited "Frog Lady" with her husband before entering the local inn. He paid a Mon Calamari server in Calamari Flan for information on where he could find other Mandalorians. He was directed to a Quarren, who offered him passage to meet a group of his people.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>The Quarren fishermen took Djarin on a fishing vessel to reunite him with other Mandalorians</b>, however, this was a ruse to kill Djarin and steal his beskar armor. The fishermen fed Grogu to the mamacore and then attempted to drown Djarin but a group of Mandaloriansâ€”Bo-Katan Kryze, Koska Reeves and Axe Wovesâ€”saved them. The trio were on Trask to seize weapons from an Imperial Gozanti freighter to use to retake their home world of Mandalore. Djarin agreed to help Bo-Katan with her mission in exchange for information on the Jedi. After successfully acquiring the Gozanti freighter, Bo-Katan told Djarin to go to the city of Calodan on the planet Corvus in search of Ahsoka Tano.

It was the homeworld of Anakin and Luke Skywalker, who would go on to shape galactic history. Part of a binary star system, the planet was oppressed by scorching suns, resulting in the world lacking the necessary surface water to sustain large populations. As a result, many residents of the planet instead drew water from the atmosphere via moisture farms. The planet also had little surface vegetation.
