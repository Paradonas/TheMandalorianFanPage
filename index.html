                <b>The second season of the American television series The Mandalorian</b> stars Pedro Pascal as the title character, a bounty hunter trying to return "The Child" to his people, the Jedi. 
                It is part of the Star Wars franchise, set after the events of Return of the Jedi (1983). The season was produced by Lucasfilm, Fairview Entertainment, and Golem Creations, 
                with Jon Favreau serving as showrunner.

                <br>
                <b>Development on a second season of The Mandalorian</b> had begun by July 2019, with Favreau looking to expand the scope of the series and introduce new characters; 
                several characters from previous Star Wars media appear in the season. Filming took place from October 2019 to March 2020, 
                finishing days before the COVID-19 pandemic forced film and television productions to shut down. Post-production was completed remotely, 
                including the recording of composer Ludwig Göransson's score.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>The eight-episode season premiered on the streaming service Disney+ on October 30, 2020</b>. A third season has been announced yet to be released.
