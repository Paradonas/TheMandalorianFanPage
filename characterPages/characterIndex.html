            <dd> ―Din Djarin on his foundling, Grogu </dd>
            <p>
                <b>Din Djarin was a human male Mandalorian</b> who worked as a bounty hunter during the New Republic
                Era.
                With his Mandalorian armour, IB-94 blaster pistol, Amban sniper rifle, and distinctive beskar helmet,
                Djarin was both well-equipped and enigmatic—a stranger whose past was shrouded in mystery to others.
                Orphaned during the Republic Era, he was raised as a foundling by the Children of the Watch,
                a group that had broken off from mainstream Mandalorian society.
                Djarin was not aware of this and believed that all Mandalorians followed the Children of the Watch's
                beliefs.
                He was trained to become a Mandalorian warrior and eventually joined the Tribe,
                which operated in a secret covert on Nevarro and was affiliated with the Children of the Watch. Djarin
                became battle-hardened,
                a man of few words, and a formidable hunter in an increasingly dangerous galaxy.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>After the fall of the Galactic Empire</b>, Djarin made a reputation for himself as a member of the
                Bounty Hunters' Guild,
                collecting bounties as he traveled across the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories—far from the authority
                of the New Republic—in his personal starship, the Razor Crest. Around 9 ABY,
                Djarin was hired on Nevarro by a client of an Imperial remnant faction,
                who offered a substantial reward for the acquisition of an asset located on the world Arvala-7. During
                his mission on Arvala-7,
                he met an Ugnaught named Kuiil, who guided him to the location of the asset. On his way to the asset,
                Djarin encountered a bounty hunter droid, IG-11 who first shot Djarin, oblivious to the fact that he was
                part of the Bounty Hunters' Guild.
                After Djarin verified his identity, the two entered the building in the encampment guarded by
                mercenaries where the asset was kept.
                Upon seeing the asset itself, they discovered that it was in fact a Force-sensitive child. Unbeknownst
                to Djarin,
                the child was a former Jedi youngling named Grogu, and belonged to the same species as Jedi Grand Master
                Yoda. Djarin,
                who was tasked with bringing Grogu in alive, shot IG-11 in the head, who was about to kill Grogu, and
                saved the infant,
                taking him into his custody.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Discovering Grogu's Force-sensitivity during his time on Arvala-7</b>,
                Djarin then took Grogu back to the Client and collected his reward. However,
                the Mandalorian warrior had already begun to form a bond with the infant.
                Feeling remorseful for subjecting Grogu to a cruel fate,
                Djarin entered the facility where Grogu was kept and rescued him from the Imperials stationed there,
                and later fended off Guild hunters with the help of the Mandalorian Tribe.
                The two would go on to embark on various adventures around the galaxy as they formed a close bond,
                including an encounter with former rebel shock trooper Carasynthia Dune,
                a job on Tatooine, and a run-in with a group of mercenaries.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Djarin was later contacted by the Guild's agent</b>, Greef Karga, who wished to make amends for his
                actions during Grogu's rescue.
                The Guild agent offered to work with the Mandalorian to drive away the Imperials, who took control over
                Nevarro's city,
                in exchange for dropping the bounty on the Child. Djarin then gathered his allies—Dune, Kuiil,
                and a re-programmed IG-11—and met with Karga on Nevarro.
                Djarin and his allies entered the city and fought the Imperials led by Moff Gideon,
                later retreating to the Tribe's covert after facing heavy opposition. The Mandalorian known as "the
                Armourer,"
                who had remained in the hideout after the covert's attempted relocation, tasked Djarin with returning
                Grogu to his people,
                and declared the creation of his clan. After dealing with Gideon and his remaining Imperials,
                Djarin departed the planet with the infant and began his search for Grogu's people.

                <b>Grogu, known to many simply as "the Child,"</b> was a male Force-sensitive Mandalorian foundling that
                belonged to the same species as Jedi Grand Master Yoda and Jedi Master Yaddle.
                Grogu was born in the year 41 BBY, and was raised at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Grogu was eventually held at a hideout run by Nikto mercenaries on Arvala-7</b> during the New
                Republic Era, having survived the siege of the Jedi Temple decades prior.
                While still an infant at the age of fifty years, he was sought, on behalf of Moff Gideon, by an Imperial
                who hired Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin to retrieve him.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>However, Djarin chose not to leave Grogu with the Imperials</b> and rescued him from the Imperial
                remnant facility. After attempting to hide with Grogu along the fringes of the galaxy,
                Djarin returned to Nevarro to deal with the Imperials chasing Grogu in hopes of keeping him safe. In the
                process,
                Grogu became a Mandalorian foundling and the single other member of Djarin's newly created clan. As a
                result, Djarin took up a new mission: to deliver Grogu back to the Jedi.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Djarin, alongside Grogu, would then travel across the galaxy</b>, searching for the few remaining
                Jedi who were left. As advised by former Jedi Ahsoka Tano,
                Djarin would eventually travel with Grogu to Tython, where he could reach out through the Force to find
                another member of his kind. However,
                Grogu was captured by Gideon's Imperial forces, and Djarin was forced to lead a mission to rescue him.
                After being reunited with Grogu,
                Djarin delivered him to Luke Skywalker, a Jedi who agreed to take the child into his care and train him
                in the ways of the Force.

            <dd> ―Greef Karga, to Din Djarin and Cara Dune </dd>
            <p>
                <b>Greef Karga was a human male and former disgraced magistrate</b> before becoming an agent of the
                Bounty Hunters' Guild following the collapse of the Galactic Empire.
                In around 9 ABY, he met with the bounty hunter named Din Djarin in a cantina to accept four bounties the
                hunter had captured.
                Djarin then refused to accept payment in Imperial credits, forcing Karga to pay him in Calamari Flan,
                after which he told of an unusual job from individual known as the Client associated with an Imperial
                remnant.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Karga was pleased when Djarin completed the job</b> and after congratulating him gave him a new
                bounty to hunt down.
                Djarin however soon had a change of heart and rescued Grogu whom he had originally delivered to the
                Client.
                Karga then led a group of other Guild members in confronting Djarin and trying to reclaim the Child,
                but ultimately the hunters were overwhelmed when Djarin's Tribe joined the battle. Karga fled and
                confronted Djarin alone in Djarin's starship,
                the Razor Crest, but the bounty hunter outwitted Karga and shot him off the ship and escaped.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>The angered Client took over Karga's city</b> in retaliation for losing his prize.
                This prompted Karga to seek Djarin's aid in liberating the planet despite his betrayal of the Guild.
                After planning to betray him,
                Karga had a change of heart and ended up fighting with Djarin. They planned to kill the Client but the
                plan went awry and the Client was killed by Moff Gideon.
                After facing a gun battle, Karga escaped to the lava flats where he was once again attacked by Gideon.
                However,
                Gideon was defeated by Djarin and Karga offered him a place in the Guild again. He refused but Djarin's
                other companion, Cara Dune,
                accepted the offer to become his personal enforcer.

                collapse, residing within a facility on Nevarro. In around 9 ABY,
                he and the scientist Doctor Pershing hired many bounty hunters to recover a child named Grogu for them
                from the planet Arvala-7.
                Grogu was finally brought to him by the bounty hunter Din Djarin, and was paid accordingly. However,
                Grogu was later rescued from the facility by the bounty hunter.
                After pressuring the Bounty Hunters' Guild, Greef Karga, a Guild agent, worked with former rebel
                Carasynthia Dune and brought Djarin to him in a cantina,
                though this was merely part of their plot to kill the Client. The Client then attended a call from his
                superior, Moff Gideon,
                and was immediately killed when the Moff's forces opened fire on the cantina.

A seasoned warrior, she was an intimidating brawler and a crack shot. By 9 ABY, Dune had put her days of military discipline behind her to operate as a mercenary. After spending time on the planet Sorgan, she met the bounty hunter Din Djarin and his companion and worked with him for a short time before Djarin departed Sorgan. Eventually, Djarin returned to enlist Dune to help him combat an Imperial remnant on Nevarro. After their mission, Dune stayed on Nevarro to work with Djarin's former employer Greef Karga. Eventually, she was assigned as Marshal of Nevarro by the New Republic.

Trained in combat and martial skills from a young age, Fett was one of the most feared bounty hunters in the galaxy during the reign of Emperor Palpatine.

Unlike the clone troopers grown from Jango's DNA, Jango regarded Boba as his son. During the last days of the Separatist Crisis, Boba and Jango retreated to Geonosis where the latter was killed in battle by Jedi Master Mace Windu. Orphaned by Jango's death, Boba sought vengeance by attempting to assassinate Windu, although his plan proved unsuccessful. After serving time in prison on Coruscant, Fett took up his late father's profession as a bounty hunter, working alongside other mercenaries such as Bossk, Dengar, and Asajj Ventress.

He tried to prevent Solo's rescue by the Alliance to Restore the Republic, only to fall into the Great Pit of Carkoon when Solo accidentally slammed a pole into Fett's jetpack. Although Fett survived his ordeal with the man-eating sarlacc, his armour was sold to Cobb Vanth by Jawa scavengers. He eventually regained it by confronting Din Djarin, the Mandalorian who took Fett's armour from Vanth. After helping Djarin to rescue the foundling Grogu, Fett returned to Tatooine where he killed Bib Fortuna and claimed the late Jabba's throne with Fennec Shand by his side.

In fleeing the spiders, Frog Lady revealed a prehensile tongue, that could be used to grasp objects. She was also able to move more speedily by leaping using all four legs, so as to better flee knobby white ice spiders.

                    <b>After escaping Maldo Kreis, Frog Lady assisted Din Djarin in a landing attempt</b> on Trask by pulling a lever to stabilize the thrusters, but it didn't work and they ended up in the water. Once they got pulled out, Frog Lady was able to leave the ship. Shortly after she heard her husband's voice at the docks, the couple finally managed to reunite, with both husband and wife thanking Din for his aid.

Frog Lady and her husband were later playing with Grogu and one of their hatched offspring when Din returned to fetch Grogu. He thanked her for looking after the Foundling. Frog Lady and her husband continued to bond over their offspring as Djarin and Grogu departed.

                <dd> ―Bo-Katan Kryze accepts the Darksaber and unites several Mandalorian clans </dd>
                <p>
                    <b>Bo-Katan Kryze was a Mandalorian human female who was the leader of the Nite Owls</b> and a lieutenant in Death Watch, a terrorist group, and later during the Imperial Era, became Mand'alor. During the Clone Wars, Kryze's sister, Satine, ruled as the Duchess of Mandalore, and Kryze sought to undo her pacifistic teachings, believing that Mandalore should take pride in its martial history. After Governor Pre Vizsla of Concordia was publicly exposed as the leader of Death Watch, the splinter group was exiled from the Mandalore system. In 19 BBY, Kryze and Vizsla discovered the Sith Lords Maul and Savage Opress. With the Sith, they plotted to reclaim Mandalore, and through Maul's planning, united several criminal syndicates to form the Shadow Collective. Launching a takeover of Mandalore, Satine's rule was overthrown, and Vizsla took control of the planet.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>However, Maul challenged Vizsla, and the Sith Lord defeated him</b>, taking the throne and appointing Prime Minister Almec as a puppet leader. Kryze and a group of Mandalorian loyalists refused to recognize Maul's rule, and they liberated Satine from the royal prison, contacting Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi for help. Due to Mandalore's neutrality, Kenobi was forced to come alone, and he was captured by Maul, who then killed Satine. When Kenobi was brought to the prison, Kryze and her rebels freed the Jedi, and Mandalore was swept into a civil war as Maul's forces fought to reclaim him. Before Kenobi left the planet, Kryze requested that the Galactic Republic be informed of the events, hoping that a Republic invasion would result in Maul's death. Less than a year later, Kryze's desire was fulfilled, and the Republic laid siege to Mandalore, driving Maul from the planet. She then became Lady of House Kryze and Regent of Mandalore. However, she lost her position when she refused to follow the newly appointed Galactic Emperor Palpatine, and Clan Saxon took over.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>During the Republic's occupation of Mandalore, the government reorganized into the Galactic Empire</b>, and a new wave of violence claimed the planet. In 2 BBY, Clan Wren of Krownest chose to resist the Empire, leading the Imperial loyalists of Clan Saxon to fight them. These actions threw Mandalore into another civil war. During the war, Kryze encountered Countess Ursa Wren and Sabine Wren of Clan Wren, who were seeking a Mandalorian worthy of wielding the Darksaber and claiming the title of Mand'alor. With the Wrens' approval, Kryze took the weapon and rallied the support of several Mandalorian clans, uniting them to fight against the Empire.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Sometime after the Great Purge, Mandalore was left devastated</b> and Moff Gideon had come into the possession of the Darksaber. Around 9 ABY, Kryze formulated a plan to reclaim the weapon from the Moff and return to Mandalore. On Trask, Kryze joined fellow Mandalorians Axe Woves and Koska Reeves to hijack a shipment of weapons aboard an Imperial Gozanti-class cruiser. Before assaulting the transport, however, Kryze, Woves, and Reeves rescued unknowing member of the Children of the Watch Din Djarin and the Force-sensitive youngling Grogu from a fishing boat. With Djarin's help, they successfully managed to steal the weapons and capture the Gozanti cruiser they were being transported in for use in reclaiming Mandalore.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Later, Djarin recruited Kryze and Reeves to help him rescue Grogu</b>, who had been captured by Moff Gideon and was holding him aboard his light cruiser. The group formulated a plan to assault the vessel and, with the help of Reeves, Fennec Shand, Carasynthia Dune, and Boba Fett, Kryze successfully captured the light cruiser's bridge. Djarin soon returned with Moff Gideon in stuncuffs, having rescued Grogu from his holding cell, and holding the Darksaber, thereby making him the rightful ruler of Mandalore. Kryze refused to take the Darksaber from Djarin, despite him willingly relinquishing it to her, in staunch accordance with Mandalorian tradition.

                    <b>Fennec Shand was a human female assassin and mercenary</b> who worked for many of the top crime syndicates. After the New Republic locked up many of her employers, she went on the run and ended up on the planet Tatooine, where she was tracked down by two bounty hunters, Din Djarin and rookie Toro Calican. After she fired on the pair in the desert, they waited till nightfall then charged at her on speeder bikes, using flash charges to cover their approach.

                    <b>Shand managed to shoot down Djarin's bike, but Calican reached her and the pair fought</b>. Shand quickly defeated the inexperienced hunter, but he was saved by the arrival of Din Djarin, who forced the assassin to surrender at blaster point. With only one speeder bike left to carry them, the Mandalorian left to search for a dewback, while Calican guarded Shand. As they waited, she successfully convinced him to turn on the Mandalorian, who was also wanted by the Bounty Hunters' Guild; however, instead of freeing her as she had hoped, Calican shot and left Shand for dead, suspecting she would kill him if he freed her.

                    <b>Shand was eventually discovered by the bounty hunter Boba Fett, who saved her life</b> with the use of cybernetics. In return, Shand worked as his partner. Following a skirmish against Moff Gideon's Imperial remnant on Tython, Fett and Shand agreed to aid Djarin in rescuing his foundling, Grogu, from the moff. This led her to be involved in future missions with Djarin, which included the infiltration and attack on an Imperial Remnant on Morak.

After taking the bridge of the cruiser, Djarin returned from his mission to rescue Grogu with a now captured Gideon alongside the Force-sensitive infant. However, the dark troopers that Djarin had managed to shoot out of an airlock while rescuing Grogu soon returned, but, while the group waited for them to arrive, a Jedi searching for Grogu came to retrieve him and rescued the group from the dark troopers. The Jedi revealed himself to be Luke Skywalker and took Grogu from Djarin for further training in the Force.
