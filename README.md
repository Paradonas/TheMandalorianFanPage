## \-Completion project for web development 1, year 2 at Erik  Dahlbergsgymnasiet gymnasium.

This was a completion project for web development 1, year 2 in Erik Dahlbergsgymnasiet gymnasium. It uses the only two web development languages I could code in at the time, and which we used in the course: HTML and CSS. This version of files uploaded to GitHub are completely unalterred since the day when I completed and handed in the project for the sake of being able to see my progress and how far I've come.

### Looking back I can see some simple mistakes

The seperation of the pages are enough for a simple project like this but I could have named all folders similarily like: AboutPages, CharacterPages, FormsPages, VisitedPlanetsPages and so on. 

If I would have done this today I would've seperated small amounts of CSS difference between the files into a Styles folder containing all CSS files. I would also have housed all of the HTML files in a Sites folder. And put all media into a Resources folder with seperation for images, sound and film.

Standarization in short.
